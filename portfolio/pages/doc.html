                This site was mostly an experiment to see if I could make parallax.js 
                function as a basic background for a site, and what I could build off 
                of that. I was heavily inspired by Heather Penn's 
                <a href="http://www.proteansea.com/">Protean Sea</a>. 
                I don't necessarily intend to share this site, but ideally if I fleshed 
                it out and added my motion graphics portfolio it would be viewed by 
                peers, employers, and potential freelance clients.</p>
            <p class="desc">
                My wireframes are in a sketchbook that I left in Connecticut, but as you
                can see, the basic layout of all the pages is the same. There are three columns
                (one for each button on the navigation below) and four rows. A header that 
                includes a hamburger menu, content area, button navigation, and the footer.
                On the homepage all of this is static, but on longer pages the content area 
                can expand and allow for scrolling.
                All colors and styles were meant to match the hope page and beetle icon. 
                I wanted a consistent, static, small layout that was somewhat reminiscent of 
                a HUD, with the galaxy background. (So it feels like you're looking at the site
                through a window that leads into space)

                Parallax was sourced from <a href="http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax">Matthew Wagerfield</a>,
                and the image gallery that takes forever to load and makes the page lag like crazy
                is called LightGallery and comes from <a href="http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/">here.</a>
                The rest of my content is original, but of course I spent a lot of time on W3Schools 
                and StackOverflow when I got stuck.

                I spent so much time on the basic requirements that I didn't get to put much 
                energy into going "above and beyond." However, in order to achieve even my most
                basic vision, I had to learn to implement Parallax.js and use the LightGallery 
                jQuery plugin. Both of these posed problems that compromised the rest of the page/site 
                and took some time to alter, but in the end and despite the loading issue on the gallery
                page, I'm satisfied with what I achieved.
