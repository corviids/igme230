                    <p>hey, my name is Maddy Baker. I'm a thrid year NMD student at RIT. I'm a fan of space, music, and
                        cephalopods.</p>
                    <p>
                        my art style fluctuates constantly, so my work features large variations of both content and medium. 
                        I enjoy working with traditional mediums, ink and watercolor especially, but including others
                        like sculpture and needlecraft too.
                        more recently, I have pursued my interest in digital arts and design as is required by my
                        major, but I enjoy digital painting in Photoshop and Paint Tool SAI as well.
                        most of my paintings were made in one of those programs with my Wacom Bamboo Create.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am available for commission when I'm not swamped with schoolwork!
                        I'm best known for my logo and sticker designs, digital paintings, and clay figurines.
